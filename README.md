# Ag2S-Self-Organization
This proof of concept simulation of a 2D Ag2S nanowire network demonstrates the principle of neuroplasticity, that is, the ability to form and reorganize connections based on experience and learning. The elements in this network have the ability to change their electrical resistance based on the voltage applied to them over time. In this simulation, the network pathways are shown in orange, and the thickness of the pathways represents the amount of current passing through the pathways at a given time point. It can be seen that at the two points of peak absolute current, there are clear differences in where most of the current is passing through. The change in polarity actually encouraged the system to reorganize itself and develop new pathways.
